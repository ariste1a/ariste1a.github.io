Hey everyone, I'm a programmer with a few years of experience under my belt. Graduated from UCSD in 2015 with a CSE degree, I charged headlong into the forray of professional software development starting at Bluebeam Softare.Before that I had a few iternship doing various things ranging from firmware testing to web applications. 
I have an interest in 3D and 2D graphics programming, as well as tinkering around with web technologies. 
Though really at heart I just like making things people can use, or at least something pretty to look at. 


Been playing games ever since I was a child. Earliest memories were with the NES on a 19 inch CRT and some PC games like Jazz Rabbit and Descent. After the N64, PC became my platform of choice ever since. Favorite games back then were Starcraft: Brood War, Unreal Tournament, Counter-Strike 1.6, Warcraft 3, and DotA. Nowadays I primarily play Dota 2, CS:GO, and League of Legends.
